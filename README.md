Spec-driven rendering engine and template packs. CI, security scanning, code review, release pipelines, quality gates — defined once as template packs, applied to any project with a single command.

---

## Quick start

```bash
pip install navi-bootstrap

# Generate a spec by inspecting your project
nboot init --target ./my-project

# Preview what a pack would change
nboot diff --spec nboot-spec.json --pack ./packs/base --target ./my-project

# Apply packs to an existing project
nboot apply --spec nboot-spec.json --pack ./packs/base --target ./my-project

# Render a new project from scratch
nboot render --spec nboot-spec.json --pack ./packs/base --out ./my-project
```

The spec describes your project. The pack describes what to generate. The engine connects them deterministically: same spec + same pack = same output, every time.

## Packs

Seven template packs, layered with explicit dependencies:

```
base (required, runs first)
├── security-scanning
├── github-templates
├── review-system
├── quality-gates
├── code-hygiene
└── release-pipeline
```

All elective packs depend on `base`. The agent sequences them; the engine renders one at a time.

| Pack | Templates | What it ships |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| **base** | 6 | CI workflows (test + lint + security), pre-commit config, dependabot, pyproject tool config, CLAUDE.md, DEBT.md |
| **security-scanning** | 2 | CodeQL analysis, OpenSSF Scorecard |
| **github-templates** | 4 | Bug report form, feature request form, issue config, PR template |
| **review-system** | 2 | Code review workflow instructions, security review instructions |
| **quality-gates** | 2 | Quality metrics baseline (JSON), test parity map |
| **code-hygiene** | 1 | CONTRIBUTING.md with project-specific conventions |
| **release-pipeline** | 3 | SLSA L3 reusable build workflow, release dispatcher, git-cliff changelog config |

Packs never modify source code, never make governance decisions, and never fix pre-existing violations — they document them.

## Architecture

Six-stage pipeline. Stateless and deterministic through stage 3.

```
spec.json + pack/
  -> [Stage 0: Resolve]   action SHAs via gh api
  -> [Stage 1: Validate]  spec + manifest against schemas
  -> [Stage 2: Plan]      evaluate conditions, expand loops, build render list
  -> [Stage 3: Render]    Jinja2 render to memory
  -> [Stage 4: Validate]  run post-render checks
  -> [Stage 5: Hooks]     post-render shell commands
  -> output/
```

Stages 0-3 are pure functions — spec and pack in, rendered files out, no side effects. This is by design: a future TypeScript rewrite runs stages 0-3 on Cloudflare Workers, with an ultra-lightweight local client handling stages 4-5.

The engine is ~800 lines across 10 modules. All project-specific opinions live in the spec and the template pack, never in the engine.

├── engine.py     # Plan + Render (stages 2-3), sandboxed dest paths
├── manifest.py   # Manifest loading + validation
├── spec.py       # Spec loading + JSON Schema validation

├── sanitize.py   # Input sanitization (homoglyphs, traversal, injection)
├── init.py       # Project inspection → spec generation
└── diff.py       # Drift detection (render-to-memory + unified diff)
```

## Development

```bash
uv sync                                                # Install dependencies
uv run pytest tests/ -v                                # Run all tests
uv run ruff check src/navi_bootstrap/ tests/           # Lint
uv run ruff format src/navi_bootstrap/ tests/          # Format
uv run mypy src/navi_bootstrap/                        # Type check
uv run bandit -r src/navi_bootstrap -ll                # Security scan
pre-commit run --all-files                             # All hooks
```
